# PUG-IT244 - Python Programming

## What is this place?
This is the repository I used for my firt Purdue University Global (PUG) course in the first quarter of 2022. I wanted to practice using GitHub, VSCode, GitHub Desktop, and MacDown to create a full-fledged code repository. This also allows me to show the course material I've taken and give other people (e.g., managers, recruiters, etc.) an example of my coding experience and what I've learned so far.

## Can this repository do anything for me?
Great question! I think so! I've added all the assignment prompts in a markdown file in each Unit's subfolder. If you want to practice along with the assignment, and then compare your code with mine, that could be a great way to get some experience! As of Unit 7, I've gotten a 100% on all assignments so I like to think of them now as almost an "answer key."

## What are the occasional extra Python files with "BONUS" in the filename?
Another great question! When I first started the class, our professor Dr. Ed Lavieri (best programming/computer science professor I've ever had) encouraged me to "go above and beyonod the assignment and course material." The Python souce code files with "BONUS" in their name are my answer to this challenge. You'll see that not every Unit has one of these (yet) and that's because of life getting in the way and me being short on time. I do plan to add additional ones moving forward, but I will change the name to something like "AFTERCLASS" to denote that they were finished after the Unit/after the class concluded.

## Can I use your work?
That depends. If you're going to submit my work as your own (especially for homework) then most certainly not. The point of taking a class like this is to learn, and to do so with integrity. In addition to that, if you, your family, or your employer are paying for your school then you're ultimately cheating yourself (and those helping you attend). You are, however, allowed to cite any resources you find here (either with direct citation or indirect APA citation dependent on the resource) and of course use the references section of my writeups for additional research.

For a super fast, easy to use, very accurate, and automatic (most of the time) citation generator, I highly recommend [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-citation-generator/).
